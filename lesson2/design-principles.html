            <h3>Visual Hierarchy</h3>

            <p>Abobe is an excellent example of visual hierarchy because it attracts the eye to both small and large elements. 
                Though the large elements tend to be of more importance, a frequent visitor of the site might be looking for the smaller links and more specific information.
                Different elements with varying levels of importance are each carefully treated with color, scale, font weight and size, etc.
                Visually hierarchy is important because it keeps the user moving from one element to the next without feeling overwhelmed, and
                so Adobe's ability to use hierarchy in navigating the user is exceptional.

            <p>Hick's Law is the idea that a user will spend more time looking for a certain part of the page if the page is crowded with many different types of information.
                Generally, we want users to find what they are looking for quickly and easily, especially if the information is more general or fits within broad categories. 
                The Item Label website uses its content as a way to avoid user confusion all together. Because Item Label has a much smaller inventory than most online shops, 
                the designers have made the decision to give the user all of the options in the landing page. Each category is clearly labelled, and it allows the user to browse their content without
                ever needing to navigate to another page within the website.

                Super Top Secret's website is absolutely gorgeous because of the way it utilizes negative space and a very simple color palette.
                It has nearly no images, with typography taking up most of the design. When working with typography, good use of negative space is essential.
                This negative space adds to the visual hierarchy, as the different elements are placed according to their importance. There is enough breathing room between elements
                to show where one section starts and another begins. The negative space adds to the overall feeling of balance present in the site.
