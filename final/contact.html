        <h2>Our History</h2>
        <img class="aboutimg" src="./images/farm.jpg" alt="farm">
        <p>Bountiful Foods began when farmer Jose Gomez met farmer's market enthusiast Annie McDougall. Noticing a gap in the market,
            they worked together to start a company that made fresh and local fruits not only more accessible, but also more exciting.
            With a passion for health, Annie set out to make delectable and healthy fruit drinks, and Jose worked with his fellow farmers
            to create a wonderful environment for local growers. Almost 20 years later, the company has grown from a small single food truck
            to multiple food trucks, as well as a main storefront. Along with providing local fruits to the California population,
            Bountiful Foods works hard to support local farmers and make organic fruits more accessible.
